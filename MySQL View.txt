  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)

--Create view from items table with where clouse
create view n_items as select * from items where price<700;
select * from n_items;
 
--It will take all DML without checking the Where condiction
insert into n_items values(8,'phone',500);
insert into n_items values(9,'phone',700);


--crete n_itmes with check option
create view n_items1 as select * from items where price<700 with check option;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.003 sec)


--By default CHECK is set to CASCADED we can change to LOCAL

CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a < 2
WITH CHECK OPTION;
CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;
CREATE VIEW v3 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;
